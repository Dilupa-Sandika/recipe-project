## Ingredients

### Meatloaf Base
* **1.5 lbs ground beef** (80/20 or 85/15 recommended for moisture and flavor)
* **1 cup bread crumbs** (plain or seasoned)
* **1/2 cup milk** (any kind)
* **1 large egg**, lightly beaten
* **1 small onion**, finely chopped
* **2 cloves garlic**, minced
* **1/4 cup ketchup** (for the meatloaf base)
* **1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce**
* **1 tsp salt**
* **1/2 tsp black pepper**

### Glaze Topping
* **1/4 cup ketchup** (for the glaze)
* **2 tbsp brown sugar** (for the glaze)
* **1 tsp apple cider vinegar** (for the glaze)

## Instructions

1.  **Preheat Oven & Prep Pan:** Set your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a standard loaf pan or line a baking sheet with foil for easier cleanup.
2.  **Soak Breadcrumbs:** In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs and milk. Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes until the milk is absorbed. This helps keep the meatloaf moist.
3.  **Combine Meatloaf Ingredients:** In a large bowl, add the ground beef, the soaked breadcrumb mixture, lightly beaten egg, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, 1/4 cup ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper.
4.  **Mix Gently:** Use your hands to gently mix all the ingredients until they are *just combined*. **Crucial tip: Avoid overmixing**, as this can lead to a dense and tough meatloaf.
5.  **Shape the Loaf:** Transfer the meat mixture to your prepared loaf pan, pressing gently to fill the pan, or shape it into a rectangular loaf directly on the lined baking sheet.
6.  **Prepare the Glaze:** In a separate small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/4 cup ketchup, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar until smooth.
7.  **First Glaze & Bake:** Spread half of the prepared glaze evenly over the top of the meatloaf. Place it in the preheated oven and bake for 45 minutes.
8.  **Second Glaze & Finish Baking:** Remove the meatloaf from the oven and carefully spread the remaining glaze over the top. Return it to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes. The meatloaf is done when the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C) on a meat thermometer.
9.  **Rest Before Serving:** Once baked, let the meatloaf rest in the pan or on the baking sheet for at least 10 minutes before slicing. This important step allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a more tender and flavorful meatloaf that holds its shape.
10. **Serve:** Slice and serve hot with your favorite side dishes.

## Tips for the Best Meatloaf Ever

### Choosing the Right Meat
Use ground beef with some fat (80/20 or 85/15) for moisture and flavor. You can also mix beef with ground pork or veal for a different texture and taste profile.

### Don't Overmix
Remember, overmixing is the enemy of tender meatloaf! Mix ingredients gently with your hands only until they are just combined.

### Resting Before Slicing
Patience pays off! Let the meatloaf rest for about 10 minutes after baking. This crucial step helps it hold its shape and keeps all those delicious juices inside, ensuring every slice is moist.

## Variations and Substitutions

Feel free to customize this simple meatloaf recipe:

* **Different Meats:** Swap the ground beef for ground turkey, chicken, or pork, or use a combination.
* **Add Veggies:** Sneak in some extra nutrients and flavor by adding finely chopped bell peppers, carrots, celery, or zucchini to the meat mixture.
* **Alternative Toppings:** Instead of the classic glaze, try topping your meatloaf with BBQ sauce, strips of bacon before baking, or melt some shredded cheese (like cheddar or mozzarella) on top during the last few minutes of cooking.
* **Binder Options:** If you don't have breadcrumbs, you can use rolled oats, crushed crackers (like saltines or Ritz), or even cooked rice as a binder.

## Serving Suggestions

This classic comfort food pairs well with many traditional side dishes:

* Creamy mashed potatoes (a must-have!)
* Roasted vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, Brussels sprouts, or potatoes
* Garlic bread or dinner rolls
* A fresh green salad with a simple vinaigrette
* Steamed green beans or buttered corn

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What's the best type of ground beef to use for a meatloaf recipe?
Choose ground beef with a fat content of 80/20 or 85/15. This mix adds moisture and flavor. Ground turkey or pork can also offer a tasty twist.

### Can I make a meatloaf without eggs?
Yes, eggs act as a binder. You can substitute with a 'flax egg' (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water, let sit for 5 mins) or a 'chia egg' (similar ratio). Some recipes also use applesauce or mashed banana, though these might slightly alter the flavor. Adding a bit more breadcrumbs or oats can also help bind.

### How do I prevent my meatloaf from becoming too dense?
The key is **don't overmix** the ingredients and **don't pack** the meat too tightly into the loaf pan or when shaping it. Gentle handling is crucial. Also, ensure you have enough moisture (from milk, ketchup, etc.) and binder (breadcrumbs).

### What are some classic side dishes that go well with meatloaf?
Classic sides for meatloaf include mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables (carrots, broccoli, potatoes), garlic bread, and green beans. A simple side salad or sautéed spinach also pairs nicely.

### Can I make meatloaf ahead of time and refrigerate or freeze it?
Yes! You can prepare the meatloaf mixture, shape it, and refrigerate it (covered) for up to 24 hours before baking (you might need to add a few extra minutes to the baking time if baking straight from cold). To freeze, wrap the unbaked, shaped loaf tightly in plastic wrap and then foil. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw completely in the refrigerator before baking as directed. You can also freeze cooked and cooled meatloaf slices for easy reheating.

### How do I reheat leftover meatloaf?
The best way to reheat slices without drying them out is often in a covered skillet over medium-low heat with a splash of broth or water, or wrapped in foil in the oven at around 325°F (160°C) until heated through. Microwaving covered with a damp paper towel also works for a quick reheat (30-60 seconds per slice, depending on thickness).

### What are some healthier alternatives to traditional meatloaf ingredients?
For a healthier meatloaf, use leaner ground meats (like 90/10 ground beef, ground turkey, or chicken). Swap white bread crumbs for whole wheat bread crumbs or rolled oats. Increase the amount of finely chopped vegetables (onions, carrots, celery, bell peppers, zucchini, mushrooms) added to the mixture for extra nutrients and moisture. You can also reduce the amount of sugar in the glaze or use a sugar substitute.
